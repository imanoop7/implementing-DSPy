# Implementing DSPy

Welcome to the repository for implementing llm qpplicqtions using  DSPy, a powerful framework for building intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

## Overview

DSPy is designed to simplify the process of integrating LLMs into applications, providing a robust set of tools and functionalities. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use DSPy for creating intelligent applications.
